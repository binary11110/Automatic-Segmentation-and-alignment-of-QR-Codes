Descrption:
Quick response (QR) code is a two-dimensional barcode that can hold different type of 
information. A QR code consists of black squares arranged in a square grid on a white 
background, which can be read by an imaging device such as a camera1. The QR code system 
became popular in many applications due to its fast readability and greater storage 
capacity (e.g. product tracking, item identification, document management, FCIS attendance 
systemâ€¦ to name a few).
This application aims to automatically segment the QR from an image. Then, correct its 
alignment so that its three corners aligned to top right, top left and bottom right

-----------------------------------------------------------

Project features:
- Images captured with perpendicular camera to the QR.
- Different distances between camera and QR.
- Images with different backgrounds.
- QR with different in-plane rotation angle.
- QR on different materials (i.e. different lighting conditions)

---------------------------

Test:
-Case1: Upright shot of the QR on simple background with different distances.
-Case2: Shot of the QR with any rotation angle on simple background.
-Case3: Upright shot of the QR on complex background and different materials.
-Case4: Shot of the QR with any rotation angle on complex background and different materials.
